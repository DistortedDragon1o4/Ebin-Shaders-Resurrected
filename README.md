Ebin Resurrected is a vibrant and performant Minecraft shaderpack.

**This repo contains the latest development versions of Ebin resurrected. To download stable releases, get them from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/ebin-resurrected) or head over to the [releases tab](https://github.com/jbritain/Ebin-Shaders-Resurrected/latest).**

[Ebin](https://github.com/BruceKnowsHow/Ebin-Shaders) began with the goal of being fast, beautiful, configurable, feature-rich, and having a base of well-written code. It was developed by [BruceKnowsHow](https://github.com/BruceKnowsHow) from 2016-2020. [jbritain](https://github.com/jbritain) resumed development of the shader in 2024 under the name 'Ebin Resurrected'. This is a fork of Ebin which brings compatibility with modern versions of Minecraft, and also improves upon some aspects of the shader, using more modern features and standards.
