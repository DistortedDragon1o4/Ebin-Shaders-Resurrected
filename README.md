Ebin Resurrected is a vibrant and performant Minecraft shaderpack for use with the [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/home) and [Iris](https://irisshaders.dev/) mods.

**This repo contains the latest development versions of Ebin resurrected. To download stable releases, get them from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/ebin-resurrected) or head over to the [releases tab](https://github.com/jbritain/Ebin-Shaders-Resurrected/latest).**

[Ebin](https://github.com/BruceKnowsHow/Ebin-Shaders) began with the goal of being fast, beautiful, configurable, feature-rich, and having a base of well-written code. It was developed almost entirely by BruceKnowsHow ([Github](https://github.com/BruceKnowsHow), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/MiningGodBruce)) throughout summer & fall of 2016. As development went on, Ebin became more of a platform for experimental low-level graphics optimizations and coding practices. Work slowed down and eventually stopped when Bruce discovered a tragic fact: sometimes it's not possible to write code that is both "fast" and "clean". It was resumed by jbritain in 2024 because he liked the shaderpack and couldn't be bothered making his own.

This is a fork of Ebin which brings compatibility with modern versions of Minecraft, and also improves upon some aspects of the shader, using more modern features.
