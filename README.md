Ebin Resurrected is a vibrant and performant Minecraft shaderpack.

**This repo contains the latest development versions of Ebin resurrected. To download stable releases, get them from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/ebin-resurrected) or head over to the [releases tab](https://github.com/jbritain/Ebin-Shaders-Resurrected/latest).**

[Ebin](https://github.com/BruceKnowsHow/Ebin-Shaders) began with the goal of being fast, beautiful, configurable, feature-rich, and having a base of well-written code. It was developed by [BruceKnowsHow](https://github.com/BruceKnowsHow) from 2016-2020. [jbritain](https://github.com/jbritain) resumed development of the shader in 2024 under the name 'Ebin Resurrected'. This is a fork of Ebin which brings compatibility with modern versions of Minecraft, and significantly improves upon aspects of the shader, such as PBR.

## Features
- Multicoloured Blocklight
- Sunlight Shadows / Shading
- PCSS 'Variable Penumbra' Shadows with transparency.
- Bloom / Glow
- Procedural 2D/3D Clouds
- Procedural Water Waves
- Deferred Shading Pipeline - Everything is correctly shaded, even behind semi-transparent blocks
- Terrain Deformation - "Animal Crossing", "Planetoid" and "Acid" deformations
### LabPBR Compliant
  - Rough Screen Space Reflections - accurate specular reflections on all blocks.
  - Normal Mapped Lighting.
  - Parallax Object Mapping.
  - Material Ambient Occlusion.
  - Hardcoded Metal Support.
  - Porosity - materials look 'wet' in the rain.

## Planned Features
- Distant Horizons support
- End skybox

## Compatibility
### Minecraft
- **Optifine is no longer supported**. The last version of Ebin Resurrected known to work with Optifine is *beta 1.11*. Newer versions may work, they may not. This is due to the fact that whilst Iris is adding features, Optifine is not, and as the loaders grow further apart, it becomes tedious to support both.
### Hardware
- Nvidia GeForce 400, AMD Radeon HD 5000, Intel HD 3rd gen **or later**. Any modern device should work fine.
- Intel GPUs are untested and you may encounter issues.
### Operating System
- MacOS is **NOT SUPPORTED**.

## If you run into problems

Alternatively, if you are experiencing a problem with Ebin you consider to be a bug, create a new [issue](https://github.com/jbritain/Ebin-Shaders-Resurrected/issues). Please read the issue guidelines before creating one and make sure somebody else hasn't raised the same issue already. **You are likely to get a faster response on Discord**.

  - Null
  - TimeTravelBeard
  - Quadro
  - BuilderB0y
  - NinjaMike
  - CyanEmber
- [Zombye](https://github.com/zombye) (again, for providing the GGX VNDF function used for rough reflections, long after they stopped contributing).
- [Capt Tatsu](https://bitslablab.com/), whose shader, [BSL](https://bitslablab.com/bslshaders/) I ported the FXAA code from.
- [Sonic Ether](https://www.facebook.com/SonicEther/), creator of SEUS and inspiration for Ebin
- [daxnitro](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1272365), original creator of the Shaders Mod

- [sp614x](https://twitter.com/sp614x), Ebin would not be possible without #include.
- [IMS](https://github.com/IMS212), for maintaining Iris and Sodium, which are really cool mods.
- [sixthsurge](https://github.com/sixthsurge) & [The Complementary Team](https://github.com/ComplementaryDevelopment), because when I don't know how to do something, the question is "how do photon or complementary do it?"
- [chocapic13](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1293898) & [Sildur](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1291396), various code references and help over the years [BRUCE]
